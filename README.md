# Skip the Headline - The Story Reaches Higher Accuracy

This project studies the impact of news on stock price changes for Apple (AAPL). We rely on 15 months of news and minutely stock price data, and apply supervised machine learning techniques. Furthermore, we compare the informative value of the headline and the story of the news as well as different time spans after the news release. Our results show that it is hard but possible to predict stock price changes using our data and methodology.
